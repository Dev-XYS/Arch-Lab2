# DNN Accelerator Simulator

This is the DNN accelerator simulator source code repository. The simulator and the analyzer are named `simulator2.rkt` and `analyzer2.rkt`, because they are the second version of our implementation. The first version was proved to be a failure and was discarded.

The simulator is written in Racket. We recommend you to use DrRacket, the IDE for the Racket language, to open and run the code. Racket can be downloaded from https://racket-lang.org. After installing Racket, you can open DrRacket and open `examples.rkt`. All examples are commented out with `#;` (the Racket way of commenting out an entire S-expression). You remove the `#;` from one or more examples you wish to run, and then click Racket/run in the menu bar. Be sure not to uncomment too many examples, because each example requires a lot of time and memory to run.
